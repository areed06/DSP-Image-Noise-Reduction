# DSP-Image-Noise-Reduction
This project contains Python code used to analyze the noise present in digital images and applies various statistical formulas to the image to reduce noise. The user interacts with a Tkinter interface which allows control over which image is analyzed, what data is generated for the user and what type of denoising algorithm is used.
