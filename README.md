# DSP-Image-Noise-Reduction
This project contains Python code used to analyze the noise present in digital images and applies various statistical formulas to the image to reduce noise. The user interacts with a Tkinter interface which allows control over which image is analyzed, what data is generated for the user and what type of denoising algorithm is used.

To use the Python Implementation, make sure all the files are in the same directory. <<Noiser.py>> is a stand-alone file used to add noise to images and does not need to be included in this same directory.
